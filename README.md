## Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. As credit card fraud continues to grow, building reliable automated systems to flag suspicious activity is critical for financial institutions.

Project Overview

Goal: Develop a model that distinguishes between valid and fraudulent credit card transactions with high accuracy, minimizing false negatives (missed frauds) and false positives (legitimate transactions flagged as fraud).

Approach: Load a real-world credit card transactions dataset, explore its characteristics, address class imbalance, train a classification algorithm, and evaluate its performance.

Key Steps

Data ExplorationWe start by examining the transaction data: seeing how many features (variables) each record has, checking for missing values, and observing the proportion of fraudulent vs. valid transactions.

Understanding Class ImbalanceSince fraud cases are rare, the dataset is highly imbalanced. We calculate the ratio of fraud to valid transactions to quantify this imbalance and guide our modeling decisions.

Visual AnalysisUsing plots, we compare the distribution of transaction amounts and look at relationships between features to spot patterns that differentiate fraud from normal behavior.

Data PreparationMinimal preprocessing is applied, such as filling any missing values, to ensure the model receives clean input data.

Model TrainingWe train a Random Forest classifier, which builds multiple decision trees and aggregates their predictions for robust performance, especially on imbalanced data.

Model EvaluationThe model’s ability to detect fraud is quantified using metrics suited to imbalanced problems:

Precision: How many flagged transactions were actually fraud?

Recall: How many actual frauds were caught?

F1-score: Balance between precision and recall.

Matthews Correlation Coefficient: Overall quality of binary classification.

Confusion Matrix: Breakdown of true/false positives and negatives.

Results and Findings

The Random Forest model successfully identifies a large percentage of fraud cases while keeping false alarms to a minimum.

A detailed classification report and a confusion matrix heatmap illustrate the trade-offs between catching fraud and avoiding false alerts.

Why It Matters

Automated fraud detection helps protect consumers and financial institutions from significant monetary losses and reputational damage. This project provides a clear example of how machine learning pipelines—data exploration, model training, and evaluation—can be applied to real-world fraud detection challenges.
